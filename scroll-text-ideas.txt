1) Billboard LEDs - DONE (again)
2) Multiple single character row scrollers at different speeds (STARTED)
3) Sinewave scroller at 16x16 or such - full screen using vrup/wrap
4) Vertical zoom scroller (8x8 glyph VRup in MODE 1)
5) Tile scroller (32x32 tiles panning around a larger map)
6) Large glyph scroller (assembled from 256 possible 8x8 tiles)
7) Single character scroller (sprites)
8) Vertical scroller 
9) Any 3D text, esp filled even if just a couple of glyphs


Vertical Zoom Scroller

8 character rows - each 160 columns
Column offset 0-7 pixels (begin just 0 and 4 pixels)
Fill rhs and lhs of each character row with bytes depending on pixels from glyph column
Use vrup to repeat rows (start with 8 times)

Extras:
- Use lookup tables for vrup to stretch, rotate, ripple
- Dither by using 2x scanlines for each char row
- Potentially add colour palette changes as well
- Use 4x sets of character rows for single pixel offsets
- Add mirror effect back
