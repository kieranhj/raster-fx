Need script system from #tb
Need Exo from #scr

Quick & dirtiest way of writing text to screen?
Need to be able to reveal the text a line at a time on sync
Need to keep the screen bouncing with vertical adjust

Could either have proper font system
Or have each line as a 80x32 byte = 4 char row block and display with VR
Pain to do vadj + vrup + palette switch?
^- think this would be easier and more generic then can switch in whichever lines from 8
   and decompress a new set of strings in the background in between which bouncing
   then script just needs to set which screen block is in which position
   assuming there is a zero / blank block

   Can't use rupture this way as would need to change the rupture dynamically as
   the bounce occurs - e.g. top band has < 4 rows and each one follows at a different point
   Could work if top and bottom bands are always blank
   Always get 28 char rows displayed but up to 7 scanlines from 29'th row
   Then 3 fixed rows and one blank row
      
Or have entire screens separate
But then how to reveal each line?
Could switch to show shadow at specific line but then need to clear potato...

Exo compresses the text screens down to <1K
Could decompress this in the background (!) to SHADOW buffer

Need to be able to switch to potato instantly
Don't need to switch effect - just one throughout

Get text working
- align lines to 32 scanline/4 char row blocks - DONE use 10.5 point font (Bauhaus 93)
- set background to &FF for colour palette change - DONE (didn't use Tom's converter)
- add Exo library to decompress screens to MAIN/SHADOW - DONE
- add script library to control sync - DONE
- fn to set which screen row for which strip
- fn to switch visible screen MAIN/SHADOW - DONE
- fn to switch palette combos
- decompress next text screen in bg - going to need streamed version of Exo <grumble>

Try to decompress 256 bytes (1 page) per frame?!
20K screen would then be 80 frames = 1.6 seconds which is fine
Might be a bit optimistic to not interfere with everything else!
